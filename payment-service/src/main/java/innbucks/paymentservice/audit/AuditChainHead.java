/**
 * Single-row bookkeeping table that serialises appends to the {@code audit_events}
 * hash-chain (OWASP A09). There is exactly one row, {@code id = 1}, seeded by
 * migration V10.
 *
 * <p>On every audit write {@code AuditService} takes a {@code SELECT ... FOR
 * UPDATE} on this row (a pessimistic write lock) inside the audit transaction, so
 * concurrent writers append to the chain one at a time and can never fork it —
 * two rows building on the same predecessor would make deletion undetectable.
 * The row carries the last appended {@link #chainHmac} (the next write's
 * predecessor link) and {@link #lastEventId} for forensic cross-reference.
