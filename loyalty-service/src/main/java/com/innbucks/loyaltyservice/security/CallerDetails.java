 * today that's SHOP_ADMIN and SHOP_USER. MERCHANT_ADMIN tokens do NOT carry a
 * merchantId; those callers supply it in the request body, and write endpoints
 * use {@link #resolveMerchantId(UUID)} to pick the right source.
 *
 * <p>{@code shopId} is set only for SHOP_ADMIN and SHOP_USER (cashiers and
 * outlet supervisors). It identifies the specific outlet the principal works
 * at, which lets shop-staff endpoints scope results to that outlet without
 * exposing other outlets of the same merchant chain.
 *
 * <p>{@code phoneNumber} is set for CUSTOMER tokens (and any other role that
 * carries the claim). It's the authoritative identifier for "the caller's
 * wallet" — used by P2P transfer to verify the request's {@code fromUserId}
 * actually belongs to the authenticated principal, so a logged-in user can't
 * drain someone else's balance.
