/**
 * Makes SMS text safe for the InnBucks notification API / SMS gateway, which
 * rejects non-GSM / non-ASCII characters with {@code 400 "Invalid message"}
 * (confirmed live — an em-dash in the body is rejected, while the identical
 * ASCII text is accepted).
 *
 * <p>Transactional copy picks up typographic punctuation (em/en dashes, curly
 * quotes, ellipsis, non-breaking space, bullet) such as the "- The InnBucks
 * Team" sign-offs (written with an em-dash) which the gateway rejects. This
 * transliterates those to their ASCII equivalents, strips diacritics
 * (accented letter to its base letter), and replaces anything still outside
 * printable ASCII with {@code '?'} so the gateway never sees a byte it rejects.
 *
 * <p>Apply on the SMS send path and on EMAIL SUBJECTS (the email endpoint
 * charset-validates the subject the same way — observed 400 "Invalid subject"
 * for an em-dash — while email BODIES accept Unicode and keep their
 * typography). WhatsApp renders Unicode fine and is never sanitized.
