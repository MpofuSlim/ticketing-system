/**
 * The standard InnBucks sign-off + contact + regulatory footer appended to

 *
 * <p>Why this exists: transactional emails that are a single bare line with no
 * signature, no contact route, and no issuer identity read as spam/phishing to
 * both customers and mail filters. A consistent, signed footer with a real
 * contact path and the statutory Deposit-Protection-Scheme disclosure is what
 * makes a plain-text email read as a genuine InnBucks message. The notification
 * gateway is plain-text only (no HTML flag), so this is text, not markup.
 *
 * <p><b>Email channel only.</b> It is intentionally NOT applied to SMS/WhatsApp
 * (those stay terse — length is cost, and the footer's punctuation would trip
 * the GSM-7 SMS sanitizer). Callers therefore no longer hand-write a
 * "— The InnBucks Team" sign-off in the message body; this is the single source
 * of truth so every email closes the same way.
